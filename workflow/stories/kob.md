### Background Context

The KochiOrgBook Utility is a community first initiative driven by Wipro whose primary focus is to provide a cryptographically verifiable digital identity for the citizens and organisations/associations residing in the city of Kochi, where these organisations/associations/citizens can present these digital identities in place of paper credentials whenever required.In the current scenario, it requires a lot of effort, time and documents to prove one's identity or eligibility. The utility aims to cut down this red tape by providing these digital identities in the most efficient and easiestt way possible.

The desired characteristics of the utility are,
- Consent management
- Zero-Knoweldge-Proofs(ZKP)
- Privacy

This initiative is driven with the help of -

- Managed Service Providers - help in conceptualizing and implementing the use cases for this utility [Wipro , Kerala Blockchain Academy, Cochin University of Science and Technology]
- Community of developers - design and build use cases for the utility through crowd sourcing initiatives
- Associations - define and validate implementation of use case
- Service Providers - define and validate implementation of digital identity services

The KOB utility is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in digital trust ecosystems and require an enterprise grade governance framework that will:

- Enforce permissioned-writes with contractual instruments that will conform to privacy regulations such as GDPR
- Maintain financial sustainability of the consortium members without the use of cryptographic tokens
- Establish a governing board so that no single organization owns the Identity Utility Network
- Require adherence to specified open standards and protocols

The goal is "Internet scale digital trust with close to 1 million digital credentials on the network".
