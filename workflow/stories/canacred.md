> DISCLAIMER: This document represents a hi-level summation of actual activity. A detailed synopsis of activities will be required to understand actual workflow decisions.

### Background Context

The [Canadian Credential Network (CanaCred)](http://canacred.ca)  is a not-for-profit organization that is focused on building a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) network for Canada. This network will best serve Canadian citizens, businesses, government, and academic institutions. 

* CanaCred is developing an open-source mobile wallet application that can be used for free by Canadian citizens to hold their identity information

* It will conform to the Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF), which is designed to meet the current and future Canadian innovation needs in the digital identity ecosystem

* Agreements will adhere to the Privacy Act and PIPEDA and will be updated on a regular basis to adapt to changing legislation, regulations, and policies

* It will be governed by representatives from Canadian businesses, government, associations, and academia

* Nodes will store data on in-house servers in Canada and personal data will be stored on customers’ phones 

Since identity is inherently fundamental in all internet transactions and daily personal interactions, CanaCred will put an emphasis on building a Canadian-focused network to provide a secure and responsive online identity environment for all Canadians. 

### Pertinent Concepts

* Bilingual: The CanaCred wallet will be available in English and French.

* Open Source: The CanaCred wallet will be transparent and contain verifiable information.

* Governance: The CanaCred wallet will provide information on the developers and governance model used.

### Stakeholders / Persona

The following subjects are stakeholders to story:

* Dave McKay (Executive Director/Convener): Digital identity and blockchain architect.

* Prospective stakeholders: TBA

### User Stories

1. Dave creates CanaCred to explore the viability of a public utility that is Canadian-governed.

2. Dave recruits a team of volunteers to work on the governance framework, network and mobile wallet.

3. The CanaCred team is in consultation with industry professionals to help establish the CanaCred network.

4. Prospective stakeholders will be invited to participate in a consortium after the governance framework is completed.

5. The utility will be launched in the second quarter of 2021

### Utility Foundry Workflow

### Learn

* The CanaCred team has been examining organizations involved in the SSI industry.

* CanaCred currently is currently in the process to join the ToIP as a Contributing Member.  We already have a team member who is participating as a Contributor Member in the ToIP governance stack.  This team member will apply the knowledge learned towards the CanaCred governance framework.

* The CanaCred team is involved in the Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC). They are working on operationalizing the PCTF for our development in our governance, software and operations to adapt to an inclusive, privacy-enhancing digital ID strategy that works for all Canadians.

* CanaCred has established relationships with international contacts representing networks in Europe and North America.  CanaCred is also in discussion with parties in Brazil and Mexico that are interested in starting their own SSI initiatives.

* The CanaCred team is working on exploring educational outreach and community engagement with prospective stakeholders.

### Convene

* CanaCred is being designed to have governance from a variety of sources. 
* CanaCred is courting stewards from industry, finance, agriculture, and service companies from the private sector and associations representing privacy, accessibility, and oppressed groups – they will operate under a non-oppressive framework.
* CanaCred would also like participation from representatives of all levels of government in Canada, as well as academic institutions.
* CanaCred will devise sponsorship tiers to attract organizations to contribute to the network.

* Dave McKay is the convener of CanaCred.

### Define

* The CanaCred team has been meeting on a weekly basis to develop a network governance since June of 2020.

* The team is currently reviewing the DIACC’s Pan Canadian Trust Framework (PCTF) and governance documents from the Sovrin and Bedrock SSI networks as the basis for the CanaCred Governance Framework.

* The open source framework for the mobile wallet will be based on React Native, which caters to both iOS and Android mobile operating systems.

### Create

* The first deliverable for CanaCred will be a governance framework for a network. It will be published and maintained online through GitHub.

* The CanaCred team is in touch with management from Sovrin, Bedrock, and IDunion for knowledge transfer and technical support. CanaCred is looking forward to being part of the ToIP Utility Foundry Working Group to continue to participate with the other regional and specialized networks.

* Volunteer technical staff will be recruited to supplement our staff to help build and maintain the network.

### Implement

The anticipated completion date for the CanaCred wallet and governance framework is March 2021.

### Maintain

Maintenance decisions for the CanaCred network will be made by the CanaCred Technical Committee once it is established.
